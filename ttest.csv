Turing war einer der bedeutendsten Mathematiker dieses Jahrhunderts und eine hchst exzentrische Persnlichkeit. Er gilt seit seiner 1937 erschienenen Arbeit ""On Computable Numbers"", in der er das Prinzip des abstrakten Universalrechners entwickelte, als der Erfinder des Computers. Er legte auch die Grundlagen fr das heute ""Knstliche Intelligenz"" genannte Forschungsgebiet. Turings zentrale Frage ""Kann eine Maschine denken?"" war das Motiv seiner Arbeit und wird die Schlsselfrage des Umgangs mit dem Computer werden.

Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives - where we go to school, whether we get a loan, how much we pay for insurance - are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: everyone is judged according to the same rules and bias is eliminated. And yet, as Cathy O'Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated and un-contestable, even when they're wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination. Tracing the arc of a person's life, O'Neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society. These ""weapons of math destruction"" score teachers and students, sort CVs, grant or deny loans, evaluate workers, target voters and monitor our health. O'Neil calls on modellers to take more responsibility for their algorithms and on policy makers to regulate their use. But in the end, it's up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives. This important book empowers us to ask the tough questions, uncover the truth and demand change.""","Computer Science","9780241296813"

But portions of J2EE can be complicated--specifically Enterprise JavaBeans. By shouldering the burden of J2EE's complexities and providing the developer with a much simple abstraction, Spring makes developing J2EE application significantly simpler. It also provides a viable alternative to EJB, providing many of the same features offered by EJB, but without EJB's complexities. Written for enterprise Java developers who have become disillusioned with the complexity and bulk involved with EJB development, ""Spring in Action"" demonstrates how the Spring framework can make coupled code easy to manage, understand, reuse, and unit-test. Spring's employment of inversion control and aspect-oriented programming techniques to encourage loosely coupled code is explained, providing programmers with the ability to use JavaBeans with the power and enterprise services only previously available in the heavier Enterprise JavaBeans.Even hard-core EJB fanatics may find some value in this book as the next specification of EJB will more closely resemble Spring than the current EJB specification.

The book is suited for students at the college senior and first-year graduate level with prior background in mathematical analysis, vectors, matrices, probability, statistics, linear systems, and computer programming. As in all earlier editions, the focus of this edition of the book is on fundamentals. The 4th Edition, which celebrates the books 40th anniversary, is based on an extensive survey of faculty, students, and independent readers in 150 institutions from 30 countries. Their feedback led to expanded or new coverage of topics such as deep learning and deep neural networks, including convolutional neural nets, the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), maximally-stable extremal regions (MSERs), graph cuts, k-means clustering and superpixels, active contours (snakes and level sets), and exact histogram matching. Major improvements were made in reorganizing the material on image transforms into a more cohesive presentation, and in the discussion of spatial kernels and spatial filtering. Major revisions and additions were made to examples and homework exercises throughout the book. For the first time, we added MATLAB projects at the end of every chapter, and compiled support packages for you and your teacher containing, solutions, image databases, and sample code.

 World-historical questions such as these, the subjects of major works by Jared Diamond, David Landes, and others, are now of great moment as global frictions increase. In a spirited and original contribution to this quickening discussion, two renowned historians, father and son, explore the webs that have drawn humans together in patterns of interaction and exchange, cooperation and competition, since earliest times. Whether small or large, loose or dense, these webs have provided the medium for the movement of ideas, goods, power, and money within and across cultures, societies, and nations. From the thin, localized webs that characterized agricultural communities twelve thousand years ago, through the denser, more interactive metropolitan webs that surrounded ancient Sumer, Athens, and Timbuktu, to the electrified global web that today envelops virtually the entire world in a maelstrom of cooperation and competition, J. R. McNeill and William H. McNeill show human webs to be a key component of world history and a revealing framework of analysis. Avoiding any determinism, environmental or cultural, the McNeills give us a synthesizing picture of the big patterns of world history in a rich, open-ended, concise account.
